# Calculating Diversity Indices ðŸ§¬

Biodiversity indices summarize community composition and evenness.  
Common metrics include:

- **Species richness (S)**  
- **Shannonâ€“Wiener index (H')**  
- **Simpson index (D)**  

Example in R:

```r
library(vegan)
data(dune)
diversity(dune, index = "shannon")
