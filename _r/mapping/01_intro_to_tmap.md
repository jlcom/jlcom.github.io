# Introduction to tmap üó∫Ô∏è

`tmap` is a powerful R package for creating static and interactive maps.

You‚Äôll learn how to:

- Load spatial data (`sf` objects)
- Visualize maps with `tm_shape()` and `tm_polygons()`
- Add legends, scales, and titles

Example:

```r
library(tmap)
data(World)
tm_shape(World) + tm_polygons("income_grp")
