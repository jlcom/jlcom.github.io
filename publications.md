  Tropical forests and their fauna are being lost at alarming rates, causing important cascading effects that can limit ecosystem functioning. A significant cascading effect relates to dung beetles, which depend on forests and the excrement of terrestrial mammals for feeding and reproduction, making them particularly vulnerable to both deforestation and defaunation. While recent studies have explored the influence of forest structure and mammal activity on dung beetle communities in fragmented landscapes, to our knowledge, no study to date has simultaneously tested the combined effects of deforestation and defaunation on dung beetle species richness and body mass across a continuous landscape‚Äìscale gradient of forest loss. We assessed whether and how species richness and body mass of dung beetles relate to deforestation and defaunation across 18 1‚Äìkm¬≤ landscapes in a Mesoamerican biodiversity hotspot. Our results indicated that landscape‚Äìscale species richness and body mass of dung beetles decrease in more deforested and defaunated landscapes. Indeed, such a decrease in species richness accelerated in landscapes with <‚Äâ40% of remaining forest cover, supporting previous extinction thresholds documented for this and other tropical regions. Our findings underscore the importance of stopping deforestation and defaunation in the region, as (i) both factors are crucial to maintaining dung beetle diversity at the landscape scale; and (ii) the remaining forest cover at the regional scale (‚âà‚Äâ40%) falls within our estimated extinction threshold. </div> </details>

**Highlights**
  - **Deforestation and defaunation jointly reduce dung beetle diversity and biomass** across tropical landscapes, revealing strong cascading effects on ecosystem functioning.
  - **Species richness declines sharply below 40% forest cover**, supporting previously reported extinction thresholds in tropical regions.
  - **Maintaining at least 40% forest cover and protecting mammal populations** are both essential to sustain dung beetle communities and their ecological roles.

  Few studies have evaluated the role of topography on the diversity patterns of biological communities along elevation gradients. We evaluated the influence of microclimate and vegetation structure associated with topographic variation on the richness and composition of species of different families of butterflies on a mountain located in a dry enclave (Chicamocha River Canyon) in the northern Andes, Colombia. We captured butterflies over four months at 18 elevations (300 to 1500 m a.s.l.) in two topographic positions (riverbed and hillslope) using an entomological net and traps baited with fermented fruit. In general, butterfly richness increased with elevation in both topographic positions. However, the richness‚Äìelevation relationship changed with butterfly family. The riverbed and hillslope sites host different assemblages of butterflies, and this pattern that was consistent for most families. In the riverbed, two sets of species are recognized along the elevation gradient (one below 700 m a.s.l. and the other above 1000 m a.s.l.), mainly owing to species replacement. On the hillslopes, there was no clear pattern of grouping associated with elevation. Microclimate differences between the riverbed and hillslope sites along the elevation gradient were related to the vegetation structure and explained the variation in butterfly species composition. Our results highlight the role of topography not only by explaining the response of species richness and composition to environmental variation determined by elevation, but also as a factor that must be considered in the planning and management of biodiversity conservation in the mountains. Abstract in Spanish is available with online material. </div> </details>
  
  **Highlights**
  - **Butterfly richness increased with elevation**, but the relationship varied by butterfly family, showing distinct ecological responses among groups.
  - **Topography (riverbed vs. hillslope) strongly influenced butterfly composition**, with clear species turnover along the elevation gradient in riverbed sites but not on hillslopes.
  - **Microclimate and vegetation structure linked to topographic variation explained changes in butterfly diversity**, underscoring topography as a key factor for biodiversity conservation planning in mountain ecosystems.
